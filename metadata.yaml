description: Originally published in 1863, Hard Cash was Reade's polemical expos of
  the horrors routinely perpetrated against the inmates of England's insane asylums.
  Alfred Hardie, victim of an embezzlement perpetrated by his father, is tricked into
  entering an asylum; once there, he finds it almost impossible to prove himself sane.
